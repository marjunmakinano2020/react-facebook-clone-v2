# Facebook Clone 
A simple, responsive Facebook Clone made using Typescript and React. 

I chose [vitejs](https://vitejs.dev/) as a build tool for this project (Thanks [@karanpratapsingh](https://github.com/karanpratapsingh/) for the recommendation!  üôå). It truly is blazing fast!‚ö°

Currently, I have implemented the feed update feature only, along with a widget. 

Deployed it using vercel [here](https://fb-clone-ayushiee.vercel.app).

Please leave a ‚≠ê as motivation if you liked the implementation üòÑ
